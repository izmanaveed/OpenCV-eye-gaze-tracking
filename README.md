# OpenCV-eye-gaze-tracking

In this project, a facial keypoints detector is used that can detect eyes in real-time. A pre-trained network in the dlib library which can detect ’68 key points’ that was presented in this paper. Dlib is used because it can give predictions in real-time.

The laptop’s webcam is used as the camera for tracking eye gaze in real time. The lighting conditions of the environment  play an important role here as they can affect the output results.

## Results 
This project was implemented using opencv and python in Visual Studio Code. It can track eye gaze in real time and tells if we are looking center, left, or right. It also detects when eyes are blinking and the number of times also. It is sensitive to the environment’s light conditions also.

## Conclusion
Eye gaze tracking is implemented in this project. The program can track the movement of pupil and tell whether the eye is looking left, right, or center. Additionally, it also detects when eye is blinking and counts the numbeer of blinks as well.
